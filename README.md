# Daymap Dark Theme
This is a chrome and firefox extention that adds a dark theme for to daymap, the learning management system used in South Australian public schools.

It is based mostly on CSS injection and uses mutation observers to inject into the pop-up frames. There are a number of know issues that for now cannot be resolved due to the poor coding and basic build-up of daymap. That being said feel free to report any bugs and we will do our best to resolve them.
